/**
 * {{namePascal}} Port Interface
 *
 * This file defines the port interface - the contract that any {{namePascal}} adapter must implement. This is part of the domain layer and should NOT
 * depend on any infrastructure details.
 *
 * Best Practices:
 * - Keep interfaces focused on domain needs
 * - Use domain language, not infrastructure language
 * - Don't expose implementation details
 * - Design for testability (easy to mock)
